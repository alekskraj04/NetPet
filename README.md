## Description
NetPet is a full-stack PWA inspired by Tamagotchi, featuring custom pixel art created in Aseprite. Pets live on a server where hunger, energy, and happiness decay in real-time based on timestamps, even when the user is offline.

## Key Features
* **Create:** Register an account, name your pet, and customize its appearance.
* **Modify:** Interact by feeding, playing, or putting the pet to sleep to manage status bars and earn coins for items.
* **Share:** Search for other users and send "Energy Boosters" as gifts to help maintain their pets' well-being.
* **Technical:** Built with Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL for persistent cloud storage and real-time status calculations.
